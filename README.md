# Code, more code, sleep, refactor, repeat
This one was challenging.. It was simple to get the basic functionality going, but then you had to deviate from the happy path and it got challenging. I probably completely deleted the code at least twice and started again fresh as I realized how everything is interacting. Even now it needs some work to get every edge case that I want.

Overall I'm mostly satisifed how it turned out. Setting it down for now so I can continue on with **TOP**
